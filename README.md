## Product Description

- The main product that we are  aiming to build is a digital flight log for paramotorists with many tools that ensure a safe and enjoyable flight. Currently this is a wide open market in Saskatoon as the paramotoring community is just beginning to grow into a promising entry-point for our technology.

## Opportunity and Value

-  Currently, the paramotoring community tends to rely on physical logbooks and their memory to record their flight info that helps them diagnose problems with their equipment, check fuel levels before their flight, and ensure that the follow the correct safety procedures before every flight. This lack of an organized solution can lead to many safety issues and concerns if people neglect or forget to keep track of their equipment and its condition. This problem can be fatal if left ignored and we believe that if we introduced an automated process for these tasks with the deployment of a mobile app then we could simplify and streamline the process. In doing so, we hope that our app can prevent unnecessary accidents that could potentially claim lives if left ignored.


## Stakeholders

-  Our main target market right now consists of the Saskatoon paramotoring community, our very own team member Alex came up with this idea as a paramotorist himself so it is good to have a developer with fresh eyes as someone who partakes in this thrilling activity. A successful project could mean that we have an advantage over other app developers as there are no implementations that we know of after doing research on existing technologies. This means that our app will grow as more and more people join this sport.

# Technologies

- We used Dart as our implementation language which uses flutter to make android application. For authentication features and backend we used mySQL to build our own database for data storage. Our early work was done uding with Figma for wireframing an UI that feels responsive to the user.
